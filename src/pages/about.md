I'm Shalini B, and my journey through civil engineering has been beautifully shaped by water. I hold a PhD from IIT Madras, an ME from UVCE, and a BE from BMSCE, all in civil engineering, with my masters and PhD specializing in water resources.

I fell in love with hydrology when I realized I could actually understand and imagine what was happening in nature without overwhelming complexityâ€”something that had always felt elusive to me in physics. There's something magical about being able to visualize how water moves through landscapes and systems. During my PhD, I also explored the fascinating world of machine learning, discovering new ways to understand water systems through data.
