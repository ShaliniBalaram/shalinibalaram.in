description: "Understanding probability distributions through interactive visualizations - from my journey recreating 80s research papers to choosing the right distribution for your data."
---

One of the first things my professor asked me to do after my coursework was to start recreating papers, and I started with papers from the 80s as they were easy to understand and recreate. I was using MATLAB then, so it made the whole exercise easier. I knew a few distributions, but I wanted to know how each of them behaved and how to choose the best one.

That simple question - "which distribution should I choose?" - turned out to be more profound than I initially thought. It's not just about fitting curves to data; it's about understanding the story your data is trying to tell.

## What I Learned from Those 80s Papers

Starting with older papers was brilliant advice. These researchers had to be crystal clear about their assumptions because computational power was limited. They couldn't just throw data at algorithms - they had to think.

## The Distribution Dilemma

When I first encountered rainfall data, I had several distributions at my disposal:
- **Normal Distribution**: The classic bell curve
- **Exponential Distribution**: For modeling time between events
- **Weibell Distribution**: Flexible shape for extreme events
- **Gamma Distribution**: Perfect for positive, skewed data

But which one to choose?

## My Three-Step Approach

1. **Look at Your Data**: What does it actually look like?
2. **Understand the Physics**: What process generated this data?
3. **Test and Validate**: Does your choice make sense?

Now, let me walk you through each distribution and show you how their parameters affect their behavior.

## 1. Normal Distribution

The classic bell curve that appears everywhere in nature - from measurement errors to many natural phenomena.

**Probability Density Function (PDF):**
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

**Parameters:**
- **μ (mu)**: Mean - shifts the entire curve left or right
- **σ (sigma)**: Standard deviation - controls how spread out the data is

**Key insights:**
- When μ = 0, σ = 1: This is the **standard normal distribution**
- Increasing σ makes the curve wider and shorter (more spread)
- Decreasing σ makes the curve taller and narrower (less spread)
- 68% of data falls within 1σ, 95% within 2σ, 99.7% within 3σ

**When to use:** When your data is symmetric around a central value, like measurement errors or natural phenomena affected by many small random factors.

## 2. Exponential Distribution

Perfect for modeling time between events - like the time between successive rainfall events or equipment failures.

**PDF:**
$$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} \text{ for } x \geq 0$$

**CDF:**
$$F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}$$

**Parameter:**
- **λ (lambda)**: Rate parameter - higher λ means events happen more frequently

**Key insights:**
- Always starts high at x=0 and decreases exponentially
- Higher λ → steeper decline → events happen more frequently
- Lower λ → gradual decline → events are more rare
- Mean = 1/λ, so if λ=2, average time between events is 0.5 units

**When to use:** For modeling waiting times, survival analysis, or any process where the probability of an event is constant over time.

## 3. Weibull Distribution

The Swiss Army knife of distributions - incredibly flexible and widely used in reliability analysis and extreme value modeling.

**PDF:**
$$f(x) = \frac{k}{\lambda}\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}\right)^{k-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^k}$$

**Parameters:**
- **k**: Shape parameter - dramatically changes the distribution's shape
- **λ**: Scale parameter - stretches or compresses the distribution

**Key insights:**
- When k < 1: Decreasing failure rate (like exponential but curved)
- When k = 1: Constant failure rate (becomes exponential distribution!)
- When k > 1: Increasing failure rate (aging effect)
- When k ≈ 3.6: Approximates normal distribution

**When to use:** Reliability engineering, wind speed analysis, extreme weather events. It's incredibly versatile!

## 4. Gamma Distribution

Excellent for positive, skewed data like rainfall amounts, where you can't have negative values but there's a long tail.

**PDF:**
$$f(x) = \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta x}$$

**Parameters:**
- **α (alpha)**: Shape parameter - controls the skewness
- **β (beta)**: Rate parameter - controls the scale

**Key insights:**
- When α < 1: J-shaped curve, starts at infinity
- When α = 1: Becomes exponential distribution
- When α > 1: Unimodal with a peak
- Higher β → distribution shifts left (smaller values more likely)
- Lower β → distribution shifts right (larger values more likely)

**When to use:** Rainfall amounts, waiting times for multiple events, insurance claims, or any positive continuous data with a right skew.

## Choosing the Right Distribution

Through my journey from those 80s papers to modern machine learning applications, I've learned that choosing a distribution isn't just about mathematical fit - it's about understanding your data's story:

1. **Physical Process**: What generated your data?
2. **Data Characteristics**: Positive only? Bounded? Symmetric?
3. **Tail Behavior**: Are extreme values important?
4. **Parameter Interpretability**: Do the parameters make sense in your context?

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. In future posts, I'll dive into more advanced distributions, goodness-of-fit tests, and real-world applications in water resources research.

Understanding these parameter behaviors is just as important as knowing the mathematics - it helps you make better choices when fitting distributions to real data!
